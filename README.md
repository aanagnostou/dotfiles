# dotfiles
DOT files for Arch Linux

Letâ€™s assume we have the relevant dotfiles together in ~/.dotfiles.
We can create a symlink from here to the directory where they are expected (usually our home directory, ~):

ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc

ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc

ln -sv ~/.dotfiles/ssh/config ~/.ssh/config
